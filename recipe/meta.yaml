  summary: A multigrid solver for 3D electromagnetic diffusion.
  description: |
    The modeller emg3d is a multigrid solver for 3D EM diffusion with tri-axial
    electrical anisotropy. The matrix-free solver can be used as main solver or
    as preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods, and the governing equations
    are discretized on a staggered Yee grid.
